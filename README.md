# changed-test-ids [![main](https://github.com/bahmutov/changed-test-ids/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bahmutov/changed-test-ids/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> Select tests to run based on source file changes and test ids

üìù Read the blog posts [Using Test Ids To Pick Cypress Specs To Run](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/using-test-ids-to-pick-specs-to-run/) and [Pick Tests Using Test Ids From Another Source Repo](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/pick-tests-in-another-repo/)

## API

- `findTestQueries`
- `findTestQueriesInFile`
- `findTestQueriesInFiles`
- `findTestAttributes`
- `findTestAttributesInFile`
- `findTestAttributesInFiles`

## Output

List of data test ids, sorted alphabetically

## CLI

### Find test ids in the source files

```
$ npx find-ids --sources 'glob pattern to the JSX files'
```

Outputs the sorted list of test attributes, one per line. For example, use `npm run demo:sources`

### Find test ids used in Cypress specs

Let's look through the Cypress specs for custom command `cy.getById` and find all unique arguments

```
$ npx find-ids --specs 'glob pattern to the Cypress specs' --command getById
```

Outputs the sorted list of test attributes, one per line. For example, use `npm run demo:specs`. You can use several custom commands, separate them using commas `--commands getById,containsByTest`

### Warn on untested ids

If you specify both sources and specs, then it will find all test ids used in the source files NOT used by the specs and list them one at a time

```
$ npx find-ids --sources ... --specs ... --command ...
‚ö†Ô∏è found 1 test id(s) not covered by any specs
name
```

### Specs to run based on Git changes

You can automatically compute which specs use the test ids from the changed source in the current branch.

```
$ npx find-ids --sources ... --specs ... --command ... --branch <compare against branch name>
```

If running on GitHub Actions, you can set the detected spec filenames as outputs by adding `--set-gha-outputs`. This sets the output variables `specsToRun` (comma-separated list of specs) and `specsToRunN` (number of specs found based on test ids in the changed source files).

### Test ids based on Git changes

You can simply detect test ids in the changed source files and output their list.

```
$ npx find-ids --sources --branch <compare against branch name>
```

If running on GitHub Actions, use `--set-gha-outputs` to set the list of detected test ids `changedTestIds` and the number `changedTestIdsN`.

## Debugging

This module uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme) to output verbose logs. To see the logs, run with the following environment variable `DEBUG=changed-test-ids`
